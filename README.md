# Steganography

# Abstract
This project introduces a comprehensive and interactive web-based application that demonstrates the functioning of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm through the use of core web technologies—namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Caesar Cipher is a classical substitution cipher technique in which each letter of the plaintext is systematically shifted by a fixed number of positions along the alphabet, either forward or backward, to produce the corresponding ciphertext. Although simple in nature, this cipher holds significant historical value and provides foundational insights into the principles of cryptography.
# Problem Statement
In today’s digital era, encryption plays a vital role in securing data transmission and protecting user privacy. While modern encryption algorithms are highly complex and secure, understanding their foundational principles is often challenging for beginners. Classical encryption methods such as the Caesar Cipher offer a simple yet effective way to introduce core cryptographic concepts such as substitution, keybased encryption, and modular arithmetic.
This project seeks to bring the Caesar cipher to life through a web-based platform that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By providing an interactive environment where users can input messages, adjust cipher parameters, and instantly observe encrypted or decrypted results, the application transforms abstract cryptographic theory into a tangible learning experience. Its simplicity makes it ideal for beginners, while its customizable features allow for deeper exploration into the dynamics of classical encryption.
# Result
The Caesar Cipher web tool performs encryption and decryption with high accuracy, adhering strictly to the Caesar cipher algorithm defined by the user’s input parameters. Upon entering text and selecting the desired operation mode—either encode or decode—the output is generated and displayed instantly without requiring a page reload. This real-time interaction significantly enhances the user experience, enabling immediate feedback and exploration.
# Conclusion
The Caesar Cipher project successfully demonstrates the foundational concepts of classical encryption through a simple yet engaging web-based application. By utilizing core web technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic, the tool creates a cohesive and interactive platform that is accessible to a wide range of users—from beginners in computer science to students exploring cryptographic methods.
The implementation of this cipher within a browser-based interface offers users a hands-on experience with real-time encryption and decryption. Features such as configurable shift values, customizable alphabets, letter casing options, and foreign character handling make the tool not only functional but also flexible for educational experimentation.
